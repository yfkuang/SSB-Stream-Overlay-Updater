* Added placeholders in inputs
* Added and specified Singles, Doubles, Commentators and Top 8. Mostly useless until I add overlays for these
* [Broken] Added link to Doubles, Commentators and Top 8 overlay
* Added collapsible sections
* Made CSS toggleable
* Redid the CSS and HTML to social media links

Stuff I wanna add:
- Finish adding my overlays
- AJAX PHP so no more refreshing for new info
- AJAX for faster load?
- Obtain Top 8 bracket from Challonge and smash.gg API so no more manual input
